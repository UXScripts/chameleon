# Chameleon Widgets

This repository contains the source code for some [Chameleon](http://chameleonlauncher.com/) widgets:

* **Google Reader** - lists all of your subscriptions into one feed.
* **Deezer** (coming soon) - plays your favorite songs.

## Using a widget

You need to add an instance of the "Make A Widget" widget. Its primary function is to allow you to load and test non official widgets. You can create an instance of it at any time and load the widget by URL.

"Make A Widget" can be found in the widget list when you edit your dashboard. It will always appear at the end of the list.

When you add an instance of it to a dashboard, you will be presented with a prompt. The prompt allows you to load a widget by it's base url.

When a widget is added by it's base url, it will appear on the dashboard as normal. The only difference is that it's chrome color will always be grey.

Here are the base urls for all of my current widgets. You can load any of these using "Make A Widget".

* **Deezer** - coming soon

## Making a widget

You can modify my widgets or create new ones, based on the official documentation: [http://chameleonlauncher.com/widgets/makeawidget/](http://chameleonlauncher.com/widgets/makeawidget/).
